I am currently studying Game Development at Metropolia University. I am well versed with the Unity game engine and C#. Through our school projects I have also learned the basics of Amazon Web Services and how to use them for multiplayer games.

My team has always had very ambitious, large projects and we have always managed to deliver a stable, polished and complete game.
