I'm a recently graduated ICT Engineer (UAS) with a major in Game Applications who's looking for his next big project.

Completing projects with an improvement-oriented mindset is my top priority and I hope that I get to work more on cloud microservice infrastructures and netcode to further improve my skills in making scalable and maintainable production-ready code for enterprise-level workloads.

You can check out a list of my best projects in the [Top Projects][top-projects] page or visit the [All Projects][all-projects] page to view all of my past projects.
