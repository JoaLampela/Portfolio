I'm a recently graduated ICT Engineer (UAS) with a major in Game Applications and I'm looking for my next big project.

Completing projects with an improvement-oriented mindset is my priority and I hope that I get to work more on cloud microservice infrastructures and netcode to further improve my skills in making scalable and maintainable production-ready code for enterprise-level workloads.
