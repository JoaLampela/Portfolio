Cube Rush is an arcade-style game where your goal is to avoid obstacles and compete against other players' highscores. The game is a twist on popular infinite runner mobile games such as [Subway Surfers][subway-surfers].

This game was Team Brute Force's entry for the second task of University Gamedev League 2022, which was a game development competition hosted by [Nine66][nine66], a member of the [Savvy Games Group][savvy-games-group]. For this task, teams had to make a game based on [Blades of Brim][blades-of-brim], which is a [Subway Surfers][subway-surfers] -like infinite runner by the same game company.

We decided to make the game using simple geometric shapes due to time constraints with generating 3D assets. The twist is that the game has different camera views, inspired by [Geometry Dash][geometry-dash], during different sections of the game to provide variety and to distinguish the game from the other three-lane infinite runners. The game was planned to be playable on mobile platforms, but due to the limited development time, only a PC build of the game exists. The game ended up winning this round of the competition.

I was responsible for the AWS services' implementation in the cloud, procedural level generation, as well as level section construction and design. The cloud services were used to save users' highscores to the cloud. As the Team Lead, I was also responsible for general project management and planning.

The game was made in under a month using Unity and Amazon Web Services.
