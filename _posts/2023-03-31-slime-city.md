Slime City is an arcade-style game where your goal is to spread as much slime as you can and compete against other players' highscores. The game is inspired by retro arcade cabinets from the 80's

This game was our team's entry for the first task of [University Gamedev League 2022][competition-page].

I was responsible for score systems, client side netcode, UI, menus and settings.

The game is made with Unity and uses Amazon Web Services.
