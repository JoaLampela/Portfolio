Slime City is an arcade-style game where your goal is to spread as much slime as you can to earn points and to compete against other players' highscores. The game is inspired by retro arcade cabinets from the 80s.

This game was Team Brute Force's entry for the first task of University Gamedev League 2022, which was a game development competition hosted by [Nine66][nine66], a member of the [Savvy Games Group][savvy-games-group]. For this task, teams had to make a game that was played entirely on one screen, with the additional theme of old-school arcade being thrown into the mix.

We decided to make an arcade cabinet -style game with pixel-art graphics. For the gameplay, the team voted on a colorful [Splatoon][splatoon]-inspired painting mechanic to accumulate score that later evolved into spreading glowing yellow slime to fit the artists' vision. The game fared moderately well in this round of the competition, but did not end up winning the round.

I was responsible for the AWS services' implementation in the cloud, which were used to save users' scores to the cloud. As the Team Lead, I was also responsible for general project management and planning.

The game was made in under a month using Unity and Amazon Web Services.
