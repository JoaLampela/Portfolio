Giant's Kettle is a top down roguelike dungeon crawling game with a rune/item system where the player finds equipment by killing enemies and unlocks new runes after each level up.

The runes in the game work progressively. The more you choose a certain type of rune, the more and better runes you will get that are of the same type.

The game also features five different weapon loadouts that will all benefit from different rune builds.

There is also a lunatic difficulty level with unique weapons and gameplay.

I was responsible for sound design, audio systems, menus and settings.

The game is made with Unity.
