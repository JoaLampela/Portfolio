Giant's Kettle is a top-down roguelike dungeon crawling game with a rune/item system. In the game, the player finds equipment by killing enemies and unlocks new runes after each level-up.

The runes selection's randomization algorithm is weighted, meaning that the more of a certain type of rune you pick, the more runes of the same type you'll encounter. The runes also have a potency, with more potent runes becoming available as the player specializes in that rune.

The game also features five different weapon loadouts that all have different playstyles and benefit from different rune builds.

The game has three basic difficulty options which affect the player's and enemies' health as well as some other values. Additionally, there exists a "lunatic" difficulty level with unique weapons and gameplay features.

In this project, I was responsible for rune design and implementation. As part of that job, I also worked on general gameplay design and did playtesting and balancing.

The game was made as a school project using Unity.
