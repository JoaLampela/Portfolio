Hard Mode is a website for League of Legends that generates themed builds that players can try in their games. The builds are bad by design, leading to a more difficult experience, which is what we named the website after.

To generate a randomized build, a user must select one or more characters from a list. The list contains every character in League of Legends at the time of development.

Character selector.

Generating a build randomly selects a character from the selected options and uses an algorithm to pick a theme for the build from the allowed themes list for that character. The algorithm then generates a build that fulfills the theme by using items that are associated with said theme.

Build for one player.

Users can create their own profiles or access the website using a Guest profile, which is the default option before logging in. Each profile's selected characters list is saved automatically and is persistent between sessions. The profiles are saved in a local database in the website's files, where each username is required to be unique.

Using the different user profiles, the website can generate builds for up to five people, which is the maximum team size for League of Legends. Users can add other players to the team builder and the website will generate builds for each player based on the characters the players have stored on their profile.

Team build for two players. The website can generate builds for a full five-man team.

I was responsible for implementing the database for users and builds. I created the API to store users and manually filled in the characters, builds, and items into database tables that allowed us to easily generate and modify builds, as well as making it possible to easily add new characters in the future.

The website hasn't been updated to the current era of League of Legends, so it lacks newer characters and items from the game.

The website was made as a school project and is hosted on a free hosting service called [Glitch][glitch]. You can check out the Hard Mode website here: [Hard Mode][website].
