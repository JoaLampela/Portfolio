Beast Brawlers is a fighting game where players control animal characters.

This game was Team Brute Force's entry for the fifth and final task of University Gamedev League 2022, which was a game development competition hosted by [Nine66][nine66], a member of the [Savvy Games Group][savvy-games-group]. For this task, teams had to make a fighting game that utilized [NVIDIA][nvidia]'s new at the time DLSS and Raytracing technologies.

The task necessitated a 3D graphics solution, so we decided to make the game using simple character models due to time constraints with designing and balancing an entire fighting game in a month. For similar reasons, we ended up landing on a side-scrolling and physics-based fighting game with local multiplayer. The game ended up winning the final round and thus the whole competition for my team.

I was responsible for the movement controls, combination moves and balancing, all of which I did with together closely with the artists and the playtesters. As the Team Lead, I was also responsible for general project management and planning.

The game was made in under a month using Unity.
