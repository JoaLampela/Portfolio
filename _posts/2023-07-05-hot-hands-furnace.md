Hot Hands is a card game with a twist: instead of taking turns, both players play cards simultaneously in real time.

The game features 60+ unique cards, player profiles with fully customizable decks that are stored online and a global chat for talking to other players.

I was responsible for the game's netcode and the AWS services' implementation in the cloud.

The game was made in under a month using Unity and Amazon Web Services.
