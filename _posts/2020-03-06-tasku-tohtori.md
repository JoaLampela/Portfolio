Tasku Tohtori (Pocket Doctor) is a mobile application that asks the user questions and narrows down the illness that is affecting them based on their answers, similar to what the [Akinator][akinator] website does.

The project was a demo for a potentially helpful health and wellness application that could give probabilistically weighted results to users in a fun and simple way.

I was responsible for designing, implementing, and populating the database for the app. I used the Room database system to store illnesses and their symptoms.

The app was made as a school project using Android Studio.
