CatEvo - Merge Game is an idle clicker merge game where the player collects and combines cats to generate coins that they can use to invest into even more cats!

This game was Team Brute Force's entry for the third task of University Gamedev League 2022, which was a game development competition hosted by [Nine66][nine66], a member of the [Savvy Games Group][savvy-games-group]. For this task, teams had to make a game that had only one button for input.

Since it was revealed that pressing the phone screen counted as one input, we decided to make a mobile game. We landed on a cute cat-based idle clicker solution due to earlier ideation about single button games. The game ended up winning this round of the competition.

I was responsible for game data saving and loading, which was handled using a local binary data file. As the Team Lead, I was also responsible for general project management and planning. Later on during continued development I was responsible for getting the game published in the Google Play Store with Firebase integration for retention testing, as Nine66 was interested in publishing the game.

The game was made in under a month using Unity.
