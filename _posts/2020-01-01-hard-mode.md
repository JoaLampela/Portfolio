Hard Mode is a website that gives League of Legends players random themed builds for their characters.
![Hard mode]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hard-mode.png)

Users can create their own profile on the website and store the characters they play on it. The website will then give the user a semi-randomised themed build based on a random character on their profile and the roles the user selected.

Character selector.

![Solo Build]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/solo-queue.png)
Build for one player.

The website can also give an entire five-man team a build for every player. One person from the team can add other players to the team builder and the website will give builds for each player based on the characters the players have stored on their profile.

![Team Build]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/five-man.png)
Team build for two players. The builder can give a full five-man team builds.

I was responsible for the front-end development.

The website hasn't been updated so it doesn't have any newer characters or items from the game.
